🛡️ Simple Keylogger
⚠️ Ethical Use Notice
This project is intended strictly for educational and ethical use.
Logging keystrokes without the user's explicit consent is illegal and unethical in many jurisdictions. This tool should only be used in controlled, authorized environments (e.g., your own device or with full permission) to understand how keylogging works.

🧩 Project Overview
Task 04 - Code Craft Challenge

This project demonstrates how to create a basic keylogger — a program that records and logs keystrokes. The main purpose is to understand how such tools function at a technical level and how to responsibly manage sensitive input data.

📋 Features
🖥️ Logs all keys pressed on the keyboard

💾 Saves keystrokes to a local file

🕵️ Lightweight and simple to run

🔐 Emphasizes ethical implementation

🧑‍💻 How It Works
The program listens for keyboard events.

Each key pressed is recorded.

The log is saved periodically to a file (e.g., keylog.txt).

🛠️ Technologies Used
💻 C# (or your selected language)

🧱 Windows Hooks / Keyboard Listeners (e.g., System.Windows.Forms or pynput for Python)

📂 File I/O operations

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   https://github.com/CyberSayanta/CODECRAFT_CS_04.git
2. Navigate to the project directory and build the application.
3. Run the program only in an environment you have permission to log keystrokes.

📌 Legal & Ethical Considerations
🚫 Do not use this software on devices you don’t own or without explicit written consent.

✅ Ideal for cybersecurity labs, ethical hacking training, and personal educational use.

⚖️ Misuse of this tool may result in legal consequences.

🚀 Future Enhancements
⏰ Timestamp each key press

🔍 Add detection for specific keywords

📤 Option to email logs (for ethical monitoring setups)

🎛️ GUI with start/stop controls
